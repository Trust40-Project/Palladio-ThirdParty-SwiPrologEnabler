/**
 * An update is an expression that can be used to update a database.
 * 
 * <p>It is assumed that an update is a conjunction of basic updates, where basic
 * updates are, for example, either positive or negative literals, or a conditional
 * effect in ADL.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Updates are related to {@link DatabaseFormula} because we view updates here
 * as an instruction to <i>insert</i> and to <i>delete</i> content from a database.
 * As database formulas can be inserted into (and removed again from) a database,
 * an update can be viewed as an instruction to insert or <i>add a list</i> to and
 * remove or <i>delete a list</i> from a database.</p>
 * 
 * <p>An update may have free variables as any other logical expression. Before applying
 * an update to a database, however, these variables may need to have been instantiated (by
 * applying a substitution).</p>
 * 
 * <p>Make sure to also implement {@link java.lang.Object#equals(Object)} and
 * {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode()}, which are needed for implementing
 * {@link Expression#mgu(Expression)}.</p>
