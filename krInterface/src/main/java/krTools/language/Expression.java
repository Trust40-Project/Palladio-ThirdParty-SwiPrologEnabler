/**
 * An expression is any grammatically correct string of symbols of a knowledge
 * representation (KR) language. For example, an expression can be a constant
 * {@code a}, term {@code 1+2}, or formula or statement
 * {@code on(a,b), clear(table)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * The KR Interface has been designed to make minimal assumptions about the
 * language elements that are present in a KR language and does not make
 * assumptions about the syntax of expressions. The examples provided in the
 * previous paragraph have only been provided for purposes of clarification.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The assumptions about expressions in the KR language that have been made are
 * the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>each expression has a 'main operator': this may either be the expression
 * itself (e.g., in case of a constant or simple literal) or a functor (e.g.,
 * '+' or the logical operator 'not').</li>
 * <li>the language contains variables (though strictly speaking this is not
 * actually enforced; the methods {@link #isClosed}, {@link #isVar},
 * {@link #getFreeVar}, {@link #applySubst}, and {@link #mgu}, however, only
 * make sense if variables are present in the language.
 * </p>
 * </ul> </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Important</b>: {@link Expression} and other language elements such as
 * {@link Var} may be used in {@link Set}s and should implement
 * {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode} and {@link java.lang.Object#equals}.
 * </p>
